# TODO: Implement Image Slider Background for Hero Section

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Modify index.html: Add a slider container inside the hero section with selected images (ccbc logo.jpg, ccbc ifaki.jpg, 20250930_194026.jpg, 20251025_103411.jpg, channels4_banner.jpg).
- [x] Update index.css: Remove the gradient background from .hero, style the slider for full coverage, add sliding animation, and include a dark overlay for text readability.
- [x] Update index.js: Add JavaScript to cycle through slider images every 3 seconds with smooth transitions.
- [x] Test the implementation to ensure slider works and text remains readable.
- [x] Enhance text color: Make text color adapt to background image brightness for better readability.
